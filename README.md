# LSE-Student-Source-and-Sector-Analysis
Introduction
In this project, we aim to analyze the data related to LSE graduate programs using Python. The focus of our analysis will be on understanding the overall situation of LSE graduate programs, admission rates, international student backgrounds, and the world rankings of LSE schools and disciplines.

The purpose of this analysis is to provide prospective LSE graduate program applicants with a better understanding of the program and its admission criteria. By examining data on admission rates and international student backgrounds, we hope to shed light on the factors that influence admissions decisions and help prospective applicants prepare their applications accordingly. Additionally, by analyzing the world rankings of LSE schools and disciplines, we aim to provide context for understanding the academic reputation and prestige of the LSE.

Overall, our analysis will provide valuable insights for those considering applying to LSE graduate programs, as well as anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the academic landscape and admission criteria of one of the world's leading institutions of higher learning.
